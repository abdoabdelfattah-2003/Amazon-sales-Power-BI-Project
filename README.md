📊 Amazon Product Reviews Analysis - Power BI Project
🔍 Project Overview:
-----------------------------------------------------

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews and product data from Amazon to extract insightful patterns and business recommendations. The analysis follows the Data Analysis Life Cycle and is showcased through a rich, interactive Power BI Dashboard.

🧭 Data Analysis Life Cycle
🗃️ 1. Data Collection
-----------------------------------------------------

We collected real-world product and review data from Amazon, which includes:

Product details (product_id, product_name)

Category hierarchy (Category.L1 to Category.L5)

Pricing (Discounted Price, Actual Price, discount_percentage)

User-generated content (review_title, review_content, rating, rating_count)

🧹 2. Data Cleaning (in Python)
Using the Jupyter Notebook **cleaning.ipynb**, we cleaned the data by:

Combining category levels into one hierarchical column (category)

Converting price values to numerical and fixing encodings

Removing duplicate or unnecessary columns (e.g., extra reviews)

Standardizing formats for consistency

📊 3. Data Exploration
-----------------------------------------------------

We performed initial EDA to:

Identify top-rated and most-reviewed products

Explore rating distributions

Analyze category-wise performance

Spot outliers in pricing and ratings

📈 4. Data Analysis & Visualization
-----------------------------------------------------

We built an interactive Power BI Dashboard to display:

Rating trends across products and categories

Top-performing products (by reviews and ratings)

Price vs Rating correlation

Category segmentation for better targeting

💡 5. Insights & Recommendations
-----------------------------------------------------
The dashboard reveals several business insights:

High-performing products by rating & review volume

Categories with strong customer interest

Opportunities to improve underperforming products

Pricing strategies aligned with customer feedback
